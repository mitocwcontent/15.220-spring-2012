This subject draws on a mix of time-tested, current and forward-looking materials. The frameworks and models for the subject are drawn from various authors including Bartlett & Ghoshal; Doz, Santos & Williamson; Ghemawat; Johanson & Vhalne; Lessard; and Porter. We selected a set of case studies of companies from different origins, different industries, and different ages. These are well-known companies and industries, and this should allow us to focus on their internationalization, global strategy and organization. Other companies will be used as examples during class sessions.
